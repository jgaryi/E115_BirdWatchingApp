Pipile cumanensisLarge, lanky, black and white bird of lowland rainforest. Note the bare, white face and white wing patches, which really stand out in flight. Crown and nape are also mostly white, but also streaked with buff. It has a fleshy throat patch that is typically blue, but it may be gray or black on some birds. Mostly arboreal, but sometimes descends to the ground to feed or drink. Song, often given at dawn or dusk, is a rising series of clear whistles. Occasionally rattles its wings loudly in flight.Identification & Behavior:Â ~71 cm (28 in). The Blue-throatedÂ  Piping-Guan is all black, with white in the wing coverts. Sexes are similar. Adult birds have pale white bare skin around the eyes and face, a bushy white crest, and red legs. Â The Blue-throated Piping-Guan is highly arboreal, but descents to theÂ ground on occasions.Â  They are often seen perched high on trees or flying across rivers with a characteristic sequence of strong wing beats and graceful gliding. Its unique plumage is unmistakable. Also, see Wattled GuanStatus: The Blue-throated Piping Guan is a fairly common canopy dwelling bird of tall pristine floodplain and Terra Firme forests. A bird largely restricted to the lowland Amazonia below 700 m; although has been recorded, in some locations, at elevations of up to 1100 m. They can beÂ temporarily common around trees bearing fruit.Name in Spanish: Pava de Garganta Azul.Sub-species: Blue-throated Piping-Guan (Pipile cumanensisÂ cumanensis) Jacquin, 1784.Meaning of Name: Pipile: L.

The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (under 10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be over 10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (over 30% decline over ten years or three generations). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.Range descriptionPipile cumanensis has a wide range in northern South America. It is still locally abundant in Suriname and in Guyana (Restall et al. 2006), but in French Guiana it is rare and very local. Its abundance is described as local in Colombia and Amazonas, Venezuela. In Ecuador the taxon was estimated to occur at densities of over 20 birds/km2 in its preferred habitat in 1994 (del Hoyo et al. 1994), but is now considered uncommon (Restall et al. 2006). In Peru, it remains common in the south, but is rare and in some danger of local extinction in the north-east. The range reaches northern Bolivia, while in Brazil the taxon is common in north Roraima, but it is scarce around cities (Tefé, Manaus) and there have been no recent records from the state of Amapá.Population informationThe global population size has not been quantified, but the species is described as common in Ecuador to rare in French Guiana and north-eastern Peru (del Hoyo et al. 1994). This species is considered to have a medium dependency on forest habitat, and tree cover is estimated to have declined by 5.6% within its mapped range over the past three generations (Global Forest Watch 2022, using Hansen et al. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Therefore, as a precautionary measure, it is tentatively suspected that this loss of cover may have led to a decline of between 1-19% in the species' population size over the same time frame.Habitat and ecologyThe species occurs in both terra firme (without flooding) and várzea (seasonally flooded) tropical rainforest types, as well as semi-deciduous forest, gallery forest and cerrado (dry savanna woodland). It reaches coastal lowlands in the north of its range. A strong preference is noted for strips of forest within 100 m of rivers, both in Amazonia and French Guiana. It has been recorded up to 500 m in Colombia, 1,000 m in Venezuela and over 2,000 m in Bolivia; the latter is likely to refer to birds searching for fruiting trees. Palm fruits are its preferred food, and it is also known to feed on Tababuia flowers, figs and snails. The species generally breeds during the rainy season, starting in August and September in Peru, with eggs having been found in February and May in Colombia. Its nest is built of twigs in dense canopy vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1994).The blue-throated piping guan (Pipile cumanensis) is a species of bird in subfamily Penelopina of family Cracidae, the guans, chachalacas, and curassows. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, the Guianas, Peru, and Venezuela.[2]Taxonomy and systematicsThe genus Pipile has been treated as including anywhere from one to five species depending on the criteria used by the various authors and taxonomic systems. At various times from one to four of them have been treated as subspecies of the Trinidad piping guan (P. pipile).[3] By early 2023, major worldwide taxonomic systems had settled on five species including the white-throated piping guan (P. grayi), which had been considered a subspecies of the blue-throated. The blue-throated piping guan is now monotypic according to the worldwide systems.[2][4][5] However, the South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society retains the white-throated piping guan as a subspecies of the blue-throated.[6]Blue-throated piping guan showing the blue throatDescriptionThe blue-throated piping guan is described as "oddly 'prehistoric' (reptilian)" but "handsome".[7] It is 60 to 69 cm (24 to 27 in) long and weighs about 970 to 1,350 g (2.14 to 2.98 lb). Its neck and tail are long, the neck and head disproportionately thin and small and the tail disproportionately long. The sexes are alike. Most of their plumage is blackish with a greenish blue gloss that is strongest on the shoulders, wings, and tail. Their forehead, crown, and nape are white, as are the fringes of their breast feathers. The outer wing coverts are also white and show as a large patch on the folded wing; the inner coverts have white spots. White to cobalt blue bare skin surrounds the dark reddish brown eye. Bare skin forming a dewlap can be white to cobalt blue, slaty purple, dark purplish gray, or black. Their bill can be pale blue with a black tip or black with a pinkish and blue base. Their legs are reddish, brownish red, or rose.[3][7]Distribution and habitatThe blue-throated piping-guan is found in far northwestern Bolivia, eastern Peru and eastern Ecuador, central and eastern Colombia, southern and eastern Venezuela, the Guianas, and northwestern Brazil. It inhabits humid tropical forest of the Amazon Basin including terra firme, várzea, gallery, and semi-deciduous types. In the Guianas it is also found in less forested coastal areas. It almost always occurs within about 100 m (330 ft) of rivers. In elevation it reaches 300 m (980 ft) in Bolivia, 400 m (1,300 ft) in Ecuador, 500 m (1,600 ft) in Colombia, 1,000 m (3,300 ft) in Venezuela, and 1,100 m (3,600 ft) in Peru.[3]BehaviorMovementThe blue-throated piping guan is thought to be mostly sedentary but it possibly makes local or elevational movements according to the availability of fruit.[3]FeedingThe blue-throated piping guan's diet is mostly fruits and leaves. The favored fruit is figs but those of many other plant families are also consumed. During the nesting season it forages in pairs or family groups but outside that season may gather in flocks of up to about 30 birds, especially at salt licks. It typically forages in the canopy or just below it but may feed on the ground under a fruiting tree.[3] The species also engages in geophagy.[8]BreedingThe blue-throated piping guan's breeding season in general spans from August to possibly April; it appears to be during the local wet season. Its nest has not been described in detail but is built from twigs and usually placed high up in the dense canopy. The clutch size is one to three eggs. The incubation period is known only in captivity, where it ranges from 24 to 28 days. The time to fledging is not known.[3]Dickcissel male perched on a metal pole singing, with neck stretched and beak open.Songs and callsListen to blue-throated piping guan on xeno-cantoVocal and non-vocal soundsThe blue-throated piping guan is vocal mostly, and possibly solely, in the breeding season. It makes a flight display with one or two wing-claps followed by its song, "ca. 6‒10 slow, clear, slightly ascending whistles, with each note becoming progressively longer...rendered püüeee, püüeee, püüeee...". The display may be given above the forest canopy, and is usually made at dawn and dusk. Another display is "wing-whirring... two quick and often barely audible wing-claps, followed by two or three whirring rattles...using the wings, prrrrrrrip-purrrrrr" The sound has "been likened to a deck of cards being fanned backwards and forwards."[3][7]StatusThe IUCN has assessed the blue-throated piping guan as being of Least Concern. It has a very large range but its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. It is hunted for food and kept in captivity but no immediate threats have been identified.[1] It varies from rare in a few areas to common. Its "preference for river edges and the species' conspicuous habits have apparently rendered it more vulnerable than other cracids of tropical forests." "It also suffers in places from habitat destruction, mainly for agriculture."[3]Abstract Guans, curassows and chachalacas (family: Cracidae) are large-bodied, arboreal birds, native to tropical and subtropical Central and South America. Currently, 51 taxa are recognised, and many are listed by the IUCN as vulnerable or endangered. This study describes endocrine patterns associated with reproduction in two guan species, the blue-throated piping guan (Pipile cumanensis cumanensis) and the horned guan (Oreophasis derbianus). In total, 1895 faecal samples were collected from female and male piping guans (n=7 and n=6, respectively) and horned guans (n=2 and n=1, respectively) maintained at the Saint Louis Zoo. Concentrations of faecal oestrogen, progestagen, and androgen metabolites were quantified using commercially available enzyme immunoassays. Concentrations of faecal oestrogen and progestagen metabolites were higher in laying, compared to non-laying, females, and concentrations consistently rose prior to egg laying for both piping and horned guans. Faecal androgen concentrations of male piping guans varied by month, with the highest values measured from July to November. This study provides the first endocrine data for guans and confirms that faecal hormone analysis is an effective way to monitor reproduction, including egg laying and seasonal changes in steroid levels.
