Tinamus osgoodi Large, rare tinamou found in cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes. It is uniformly sooty gray, much darker and plainer than Gray Tinamou. Rusty lower underparts are hard to see in the field. Like other forest tinamous, it is far more likely to be heard than seen. Vocalizations include a low, drawn out coo, like a doveâ€™s but longer, and a series of low, modulated whistles.Identification & Behavior:Â ~43 cm (17 in). The Black Tinamou is sooty gray without barring or vermiculation. It looks black in the poorly lit forest floor. The legs are light gray. It resembles the Hooded Tinamou, with which it may have limited range overlap.Â  Black Tinamou is uniformly sooty gray versus a brown and dusky Hooded Tinamou. Also, see the smaller Brown Tinamou.Status: The Black Tinamou is restricted to a narrow altitudinal band in the Andean foothills of extreme southeast Peru. It is known at elevations ranging from 900 to 1650 m where is uncommon to rare. It also occurs in Co and Ec.Name in Spanish: Perdiz Negra.Sub-species: Black Tinamou (Tinamus osgoodi osgoodi) Conover, 1949Meaning of Name: Tinamus: Tinamu (Galibi) Cayenne Language. Native name for this type of bird. osgoodi: After Wilfred Hudson Osgood, American Zoologist, collector, and author of the Mammals of Chile, 1923.See more ofÂ the Family Tinamidae ÂJustification for Red List categoryAlthough recent records indicate that this species's range is larger than previously thought, it has been retained as Vulnerable because new observations regarding the level of hunting pressure experienced by the species, in addition to ongoing habitat loss and degradation, suggest that its population is undergoing a rapid decline.Range descriptionTinamus osgoodi has an apparently highly disjunct range in the Andes of northern and central South America. Subspecies hershkovitzi occurs on the western slope of the East Andes in Huila, Colombia, where its current status is unknown (last seen in 1976, according to Hilty and Brown 1986). Records from the northern Central Andes of Antioquia, Colombia, in 1999-2000 (A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, Cuervo et al. 2008) are considered hypothetical (Fundación ProAves de Colombia 2011). In August 2001, a bird was reported from Shishicho, just north of Puerto Libre, Ecuador, near the border with Colombia (T. S. Schulenberg in litt. 2001, Pitman et al. 2002). This represents the first sight record for the country, following a sound recording of a bird at the Loreto Road, Napo, in June 1998 (D. M. Brinkhuizen in litt. 2011, Brinkhuizen and Córdova Saeteros 2011). In December 2008, an individual of this species was photographed in the Cordillera de Huacamayos, Napo, providing evidence that the birds found in Ecuador belong to subspecies hershkovitzi (Brinkhuizen and Córdova Saeteros 2011). There are reports that the species was photographed by camera traps near the Loreto Road in the relatively new Narupa Reserve during 2009, and there are undocumented reports that this species has been heard and photographed using camera traps at the base of Sumaco Volcano (D. M. Brinkhuizen in litt. 2011, Brinkhuizen and Córdova Saeteros 2011). The increasing number of records from Ecuador suggest that the species's range is more extensive and less disjunct than previously thought (Brinkhuizen and Córdova Saeteros 2011). The nominate form occurs on the eastern slope of the Andes in Cuzco, Puno and Madre de Dios, south-eastern Peru, where it has been described as common (at least until 1958), fairly common and uncommon at three known locations (Clements and Shany 2001). A sizeable population may exist in Manu National Park, Madre de Dios and Cuzco. It was found to be "remarkably abundant" in the Megantoni Reserved Zone (Vriesendorp et al. 2004). It was more recently found in a fourth area, the isolated Cerros del Sira in Huanaco, central Peru, where at least five birds were seen and further individuals were heard during biological inventories in 2005-2006 (Gastañaga et al. 2007). A report from 2007 concerns a single bird at 419 m in Yanachaga-Chemillén National Park (O. Gonzalez in litt. 2011). In addition, unpublished records exist from Parque Nacional Madidi in La Paz Department, Bolivia (T. Valqui pers. comm. per Vriesendorp et al. 2004).Population informationBased on the recorded population densities of closely-related species (Tinamus tao: 1 individual/km2 and Crypturellus soui: 2 individuals/km2 in Peru (Terborgh et al. 1990)) and the area of mapped range (28,700 km2), and assuming that the range is between 10.3% and 11.28% occupied, the population is estimated to fall within the band 2,956 - 6,475 individuals, roughly equating to 1,971 – 4,317 mature individuals, rounded here to 1,900 – 4,400 mature individuals.Trend justificationThe species's population is suspected to be undergoing a rapid decline, based in part on recent observations regarding the level of hunting pressure in some areas (Gastañaga et al. 2007, R. MacLeod and M. Gastañaga in litt. 2011), in addition to ongoing habitat loss and degradation.Habitat and ecologyThis is a poorly known species of premontane and montane humid forest, including 'valley cloud forest' (stunted, moss-enshrouded trees) in Madre de Dios (P. Champlin in litt 1998), and may require primary forest (A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999). The northern subspecies is known from 1,400-2,100 m, whereas the nominate subspecies is generally found at 600-1,650 m. In Peru, breeding-condition specimens have been taken in March-November and a quarter-grown chick was collected in February. One specimen had its stomach and crop full of nuts.Threats impacting the speciesMost intermontane foothill forest in Colombia has been cleared for agriculture and human settlement, and the rate of habitat loss has increased recently with improvements to the road network in Huila (P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999). Opium plantations are spreading, even within Cueva de los Guácharos National Park, Huila (Wege and Long 1995, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999). In its Peruvian range, human settlement and agricultural development of forests occurs largely below 900 m. However, oil exploration is taking place in the foothills of south-east Peru, and roads built to facilitate this are being settled (H. Lloyd in litt. 1999). It is hunted for food (P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999) and is a favourite target for hunters in the Sira Mountains, some of whom enter the area exclusively to hunt the species (Gastañaga et al. 2007). Observations suggest that the species is uncommon or absent in areas frequented by hunters, and hunters themselves report having to go ever higher into the mountains to find the species (R. MacLeod and M. Gastañaga in litt. 2011). The rate of habitat loss in north-eastern Ecuador is increasing rapidly, driven by logging and conversion to cattle pastures and cultivation (D. M. Brinkhuizen in litt. 2011).Conservation actions underway and neededConservation Actions UnderwayThe species has been recorded in several protected areas, across all three range states. There are several records from in and around Manu National Park (P. Champlin in litt. 1998). Subspecies hershkovitzi has been recorded in Cueva de los Guácharos National Park, Huila (Hilty and Brown 1986). Sira Mountains are included in Sira Communal Reserve but this does not provide effective protection against hunting (Gastañaga et al. 2007). The recently created Megantoni Reserved Zone may be a "main population centre" for this species, since it is "remarkably abundant" here (Vriesendorp et al. 2004).Conservation Actions ProposedSearch for additional populations, especially in less surveyed areas (H. Lloyd in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999). Investigate the taxonomy of the disjunct populations (A. Cuervo in litt. 1999, P. G. W. Salaman in litt. 1999). Incorporate the Tavara-Candamo area into Bahuaja-Sonene National Park (H. Lloyd in litt. 1999). Control tourism in the foothills of south-east Peru (H. Lloyd in litt. 1999). Support conservation education programmes (H. Lloyd in litt. 1999), particularly to prevent hunting in the Cerro del Sira.The black tinamou (Tinamus osgoodi) is a species of ground bird found in humid foothill and montane forest in the Andes of South America.TaxonomyAll tinamous are from the family Tinamidae and members of the infraclass Palaeognathae. Tinamous are the only members from their infraclass that aren't ratites, and can even fly, albeit poorly. All paleognaths evolved from prehistoric flying birds, and tinamous are the closest living relative of these birds.[3] This species of tinamous was first described by Henry Boardman Conover in 1949 based on a specimen from Cusco in Peru.[3]It has two subspecies:T. o. hershkovitzi: Almost entirely restricted to the Colombian Andes, where found at altitudes between 1,400 and 2,100 m (4,600 and 6,900 ft).[1][3][4] It is known from the west slope of the East Andes in the Huila Department, and San José de la Fragua on the east slope of the East Andes in the Caquetá Department.[1] Reports from the northern Central Andes in the Antioquia Department in Colombia, and the north-eastern Andes in the Napo and Sucumbíos Provinces in Ecuador likely also involve this subspecies.[1][5]T. o. osgoodi: Found on the east slope of the Peruvian Andes in Cuzco, Puno, Madre de Dios, and Huánuco.[6] It is mainly found at altitudes of 900 to 1,400 m (3,000 to 4,600 ft), but locally occurs up to 2,100 m (6,900 ft).[7]DescriptionThe black tinamou is a stocky terrestrial bird with a short tail and rounded wings. It is comparatively larger than other tinamous and tends to be about 40 to 46 cm (16–18 in) long, with females being a little larger than males. A male black tinamou has an average wingspan of about 234 to 248 mm (9.2–9.8 in), and a female black tinamou has an average wingspan of 239 to 256 mm (9.4–10.1 in). While there is no record of the average mass of a black tinamou, a male specimen weighing 1,285 g (45.3 oz) has been examined at the Field Museum of Natural History. It is primarily slate grey, rather than truly black as its name would imply. The upperparts of an adult black tinamou are a uniform grey, while its midsection and greater wing coverts are sometimes edged with brown. Its lower breasts and flanks are a sooty brown color, as well as its belly. It has a rufescent vent, which may or may not have black speckling, depending on the subspecies. Its maxilla is black, and its mandible is a light grey. The black tinamou has blue-grey legs and dark brown eyes. An adolescent black tinamou is similar in color, but with whitish spots on the coverts of its wings. Black tinamou chicks generally have a light brown head with a broad, cinnamon-brown stripe extending from the crest of their heads to the napes of their necks. They have whitish throats and chins. Their neck, upper back and upper breast are a dusty brown. A black tinamou chick's lower back and rump is a dirty buff color, and its lower breast and belly range from dusky brown to pale brown.The black tinamou has a tremulous and descending whistle lasting about one second. The whistle is similar to that of a white-throated tinamou, even sharing the same first note.[3][6][8]BehaviorVirtually nothing is known about the behavior of the black tinamou, but it is likely similar to that of its relatives. Nuts have been found in the crop of one specimen.[1]ReproductionThe only nest known was on the ground and contained 2 glossy blue eggs.[3] In Peru, adults in breeding condition have been recorded between March and November, and a chick was found in February.[1]ConservationThe black tinamou is rated as Vulnerable by the IUCN with a range occurrence of 11,600 km2 (4,500 sq mi). In 2004 it was estimated that fewer than 10,000 remained.[6] There are few recent records from Colombia.[1] It was formerly described as locally common in Peru,[1] but is now rare in that country.[7] The black tinamou has been recorded in several reserves, notably the Megantoni National Sanctuary, Manú National Park and Sira Communal Reserve in Peru, Sumaco Napo-Galeras National Park in Ecuador, and the Cueva de los Guácharos National Park in Colombia.[5][6][9]The black tinamou is threatened by deforestation or loss of habitat caused by human settlement expansion, agricultural expansion, road-building, oil exploration in Peru, and it is hunted for food.[1] Even within reserves, hunting and habitat loss are ongoing.[6][9]ABSTRACT The Black Tinamou (Tinamus osgoodi) is a rare and endangered bird with two geographically disjunct subspecies. Very little pertinent information exists due to its secretive habits and cryptic coloration. Observations from a one-year study at Alto Fragua Indi Wasi National Park in southern Colombia have provided new ecological information for T. o. hershkovitzi. This subspecies vocalizes mostly between March and April, suggesting that the breeding season occurs during the first half of the year. Detections by camera traps indicate that this tinamou is more active in late morning, a pattern also found in other lowland tinamous. The subspecies was found in the entire study area, but more commonly at middle altitudes (1,400–1,600 m). We estimated a density of 13.47 birds km2 , which is relatively high compared with the abundance of other tinamous of similar size. Despite the locally observed high density of this subspecies of Black Tinamou, high rates of logging and hunting in the area make this population vulnerable to rapid decline in the future.
