Pionus tumultuosusMedium-sized parrot, short square tail, body all green with blue head and red undertail coverts. Plumage is distinctive if seen well. Sexes alike. Note deep wingbeats that don‰Ûªt come above horizontal on the upbeat. Screeching call note rises noticeably in pitch, usually given doubled or tripled.Identification & Behavior:å ~27 cm (10.6 in). The Speckle-faced Parrot has a red wine foreheadå (tumultuosus) or pale foreheadå and gray headå (seniloides) and pale specks on the cheeks, sides of the neck, and nape. The breast is dusky blue or gray. The bill is pale. The undertail coverts are bright red. It is similar to the Red-billed Parrot, and the Blue-headed Parrot, but is distinguished by having a heavily speckled head.Status: The Speckle-faced Parrot is uncommon on the east slope of the Andes at elevation ranging between 1400-3300 m. It also occurs in humid forest on the west slope of the Andes in the Department of Cajamarca.å It also occurs in Co, Ec, and Bo.Name in Spanish: Loro Tumultuoso.Sub-species: Speckle-faced Parrot (Pionus tumultuosus seniloides), Massena and SouancÌ©, 1854.å CE Colombia and N Ecuador to NW Peru.(P. t. tumultuosus), Tschudi, 1844.å C & S Peru (S from HuÌÁnuco) and mountains of Bolivia (E to Santa Cruz).Meaning of Name: Pionus: Gr.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (>30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (<10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be >10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.Population informationThe global population size has not been quantified, but this species is described as 'fairly common but patchily distributed' (Stotz et al. 1996).Trend justificationThe population is suspected to be in decline owing to ongoing habitat destruction.
The plum-crowned parrot (Pionus tumultuosus) or plum-crowned pionus is a species of bird in subfamily Arinae of the family Psittacidae, the African and New World parrots. It is found in Bolivia and Peru.[3]Taxonomy and systematicsThe plum-crowned parrot's taxonomy has not been settled. The International Ornithological Committee and BirdLife International's Handbook of the Birds of the World consider it to be a full species.[3][4] The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithological Society (SACC) and the Clements taxonomy treat it and the white-capped parrot (P. seniloides) as subspecies of the speckle-faced parrot under the binomial P. tumultuosus.[5][6] The SACC declined to split the speckle-faced in 2005 but recognizes that a 2007 study suggests that the split is valid.[7][8][5]Plum-crowned parrot in cloud forest near Cock-of-the-Rock Lodge, PeruDescriptionThe plum-crowned parrot is 29 to 30 cm (11 to 12 in) long and weighs about 229 g (8.1 oz). Adults' forehead and crown are plum and the rest of their face, their throat, and their breast are dull purple with plum pink flecks. Their back, wings, and belly are green. Their undertail coverts and the base of their tail are red; the rest of their tail is green with some blue on the outer feathers. Their bill is pale yellowish horn-colored, their iris dark with grayish skin around it, and their legs and feet gray. Immature birds have a brownish green crown and breast, white speckles on their ear coverts, and yellowish green undertail coverts.[9]Distribution and habitatThe plum-crowned parrot is found on the east side of the Andes from the Department of Hu‡nuco in central Peru east through Bolivia into Santa Cruz Department. It inhabits humid subtropical forest and cloudforest, especially areas with bamboo, and visits nearby agricultural areas as well. In elevation it mostly occurs between 2,000 and 3,300 m (6,600 and 10,800 ft).[9]BehaviorMovementThe plum-crowned parrot is somewhat nomadic.[9]FeedingLittle is known about the plum-crowned parrot's foraging behavior or diet. It is known to feed on fruits; those of Turpinia paniculata and members of family Clusiaceae have been identified. It also feeds in maize fields.[9]BreedingThe plum-crowned parrot is thought to breed in November and December. Its breeding biology in the wild is not known; in captivity its clutch size is four eggs and the incubation period is about 26 days. In the wild it is assumed to nest in tree cavities like others of its genus.[9]Dickcissel male perched on a metal pole singing, with neck stretched and beak open.Songs and callsListen to plum-crowned parrot on xeno-cantoVocalizationThe plum-crowned parrot's flight call is "a low, harsh crrah." It makes a variety of "conversational" calls, some of them nasal, when perched.[9]StatusThe IUCN has assessed the plum-crowned parrot as being of Least Concern. It has a fairly large range but its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified.[1] It is considered "[g]enerally uncommon and local".[9]AbstractThe mechanisms underlying the taxonomic assembly of montane biotas are still poorly understood. Most hypotheses have assumed that the diversification of montane biotas is loosely coupled to Earth history and have emphasized instead the importance of multiple long-distance dispersal events and biotic interactions, particularly competition, for structuring the taxonomic composition and distribution of montane biotic elements. Here we use phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of species in the parrot genus Pionus to demonstrate that standing diversity within montane lineages is directly attributable to events of Earth history. Phylogenetic relationships confirm three independent biogeographic disjunctions between montane lineages, on one hand, and lowland dry-forest/wet-forest lineages on the other. Temporal estimates of lineage diversification are consistent with the interpretation that the three lineages were transported passively to high elevations by mountain building, and that subsequent diversification within the Andes was driven primarily by Pleistocene climatic oscillations and their large-scale effects on habitat change. These results support a mechanistic link between diversification and Earth history and have general implications for explaining high altitudinal disjuncts and the origin of montane biotas.
