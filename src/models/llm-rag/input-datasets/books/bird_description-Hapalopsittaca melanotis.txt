Hapalopsittaca melanotisScarce parrot of Andean cloud forest. There are two isolated populations, one in central Peru and the other in central Bolivia. Plumage is green with mostly black wings, blue wingtips, a faint blue collar, and a grayish or buffy ear patch (which is very indistinct on some birds). Usually seen flying rapidly over the forest canopy, then quickly disappearing into the trees, where it becomes very hard to spot.Identification & Behavior:å ~23 cm (9 in). The Black-winged Parrot has black wing coverts and blue primary flight feathers. It has dusky ear or auricular patches, hence, it is also called Black-eared Parrot. The tail is relatively short and pointy. It forages quietly in the canopy of humid montane forests on the east slope of the Andes. It is often seen flying in pairs or small flocks. It resembles the Spot-winged Parrot, but their ranges are not known to overlap.Status: The Black-winged Parrot is rare on the humid forest of the east slope of the Andes at elevations within 1950-3100 m.å It also occurs in Bo.Name in Spanish: Loro de Ala Negra.Sub-species: Black-winged Parrot (Hapalopsittaca melanotis peruviana), Carriker, 1932.Meaning of Name: Hapalopsittaca: Gr. Hapalos= delicate and ptilon= feather, plumage. melanops: L. mela= black, dark and pteros= winged.See more ofå the Family Psittacidaeå  åJustification for Red List categoryThis species has a large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence under 20,000 km? combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (under 10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be over 10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (over 30% decline over ten years or three generations). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.Population informationThe global population size has not been quantified, but this species is described as 'rare and patchily distributed' (Stotz et al. 1996). This species is considered to have a medium dependency on forest habitat, and tree cover is estimated to have declined by 2.9% within its mapped range over the past three generations (Global Forest Watch 2022, using Hansen et al. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Therefore, as a precautionary measure, it is tentatively suspected that this loss of cover may have led to a decline of between 1-19% in the species' population size over the same time frame.
The black-winged parrot (Hapalopsittaca melanotis), also known as the black-eared parrot, is a species of bird in subfamily Arinae of the family Psittacidae, the African and New World parrots. It is found in Bolivia and Peru.[5]Taxonomy and systematicsEarly in the 20th century the black-winged parrot shared genus Pionopsitta with the pileated parrot (P. pileata).[6] It has two subspecies, the nominate H. m. melanotis (Lafresnaye, 1847) and H. m. peruviana (Carriker, 1932).[5] There have been suggestions that peruviana deserves to be treated as a full species.[7]DescriptionThe black-winged parrot is about 24 cm (9.4 in) long. Adults of both subspecies are mostly green that is more yellowish on their underparts. Their crown has a blue-gray tinge, their lores are blue, and pinkish feathers surround the eye. The nominate subspecies has black ear coverts; those of H. m. peruviana are buff. The nominate has a wide blue-gray collar; that of peruviana is narrower. Both subspecies have largely black wings but for the mostly blue primaries. Their tail is green tipped, with blackish blue.[7]Distribution and habitatThe two subspecies of the black-winged parrot have disjunct ranges. The nominate is found in central-west Bolivia between the departments of La Paz and Santa Cruz. H. m. peruviana is found in central and southern Peru, from Hu‡nuco to Jun’n and Cuzco. The species inhabits humid montane evergreen forest, cloudforest, and elfin forest, even when in patches rather than continuous. In elevation it ranges between 1,740 and 3,450 m (5,700 and 11,300 ft).[7]BehaviorMovementThe black-winged parrot's movements have not been fully defined. It may inhabit the higher elevations only seasonally, and it appears to be nomadic in search of food.FeedingThe black-winged parrot's diet is berries, with those of Gaiadendron mistletoe being highly favored. Flocks of up to 50 have been observed moving between patches of forest in search of fruit.[7]BreedingNothing is known about the black-winged parrot's breeding biology.[7]Dickcissel male perched on a metal pole singing, with neck stretched and beak open.Songs and callsListen to black-winged parrot on xeno-cantoVocalizationThe black-winged parrot's flight call is "a series of 1Ð3 short, rather mellow-sounding notes, sometimes followed by a higher-pitched more piercing note, e.g. Òcrrit ... crrit ... crrit .. kieÓ." It makes "a wider variety of short, mellow calls" when perched, and on take-off "may produce a faster and longer series of ÒcrritÓ notes."[7]StatusThe IUCN has assessed the black-winged parrot as being of Least Concern. Though it has a somewhat limited range and its population size is not known, the latter appears to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified.[1] "Locally common, sometimes occurring in fairly large flocks, but evidently scarcer in Peru than Bolivia."
