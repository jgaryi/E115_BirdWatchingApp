Andigena hypoglaucaStunning, ornately-colored toucan of high Andean cloud forest. While the general plumage pattern is similar to other mountain-toucans, the multicolored coral, black, and yellow-striped bill separates it from all others. Eye is yellow in most of Peru, dark elsewhere in its range. Typically encountered in pairs or small groups that forage in the forest canopy. Often noisy, giving long, rising screams or short, excited yaps.Justification for Red List categoryThis species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence <20,000 km? combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (>30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size may be moderately small to large, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (<10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be >10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.Range descriptionAndigena hypoglauca occurs in montane Andean forests from central Colombia through Ecuador to southern Peru.Population informationThe species is described as uncommon to locally common (Stotz et al. 1996, Short and Kirwan 2020). In Colombia, densities of 4.6-8.8 individuals/km2 could be observed (Renjifo et al. 2014 and references therein), though this may be an overestimate (E. Botero-Delgadillo in litt. 2023). Assuming that these densities are representative for the entire range, and assuming that only 25% of forests within the range are occupied to account for the species' apparent rarity and localised occurrence (i.e., 8,000-13,000 km2; Global Forest Watch 2022), the global population may number c.36,800-114,400 individuals. This roughly equates to 25,000-77,000 mature individuals.Trend justificationThe population trend has not been investigated, but it is feared that the species is undergoing a decline as a consequence of habitat loss and fragmentation. It is reportedly rarer in secondary forests and plantations than in mature forests (Renjifo et al. 2014).Over three generations (16.9 years), 2% of tree cover is lost within the range (Global Forest Watch 2022, using Hansen et al. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). Rates of forest loss can however be locally higher, and habitat continues to be degraded and fragmented (Short and Kirwan 2020). Moreover, similar to its congener A. laminirostris, it may depend on tall trees and standing deadwood for nesting sites (per Short and Sharpe 2020) so that the population is disproportionately affected by habitat loss and selective logging. Nevertheless, most deforestation is happening below the species' altitudinal range, and high-elevation forests currently appear at low risk (Short and Kirwan 2020, Global Forest Watch 2022).It cannot be ruled out that the species is locally hunted, though its impact, if at all, is unlikely to be major (per Renjifo et al. 2014). Consequently, a slow population decline is suspected, which is here tentatively placed in the band 1-19% over three generations.Habitat and ecologyIt occurs in wet montane and cloud forest, but also in stunted forest near the tree-line, forest edge and mature secondary forest, mostly at 2,000-3,650 m, but occasionally to 1,390 m and up to 4,270 m (Short and Kirwan 2020).Threats impacting the speciesThe main threat to this species is the logging and fragmentation of high Andean forests for conversion for agriculture, livestock grazing, mining and firewood collection (Renjifo et al. 2014, Short and Kirwan 2020). Most deforestation is however currently focussed on areas below the species' altitudinal range; tree cover loss within the range is low (Global Forest Watch 2022). Rates of logging may however be locally high, e.g. in northern Peru (Barnes et al. 1995, Dinerstein et al. 1995, Stattersfield et al. 1998, Global Forest Watch 2022). The species may also locally be hunted, but likely at a very low rate (Renjifo et al. 2014).The grey-breasted mountain toucan (Andigena hypoglauca) is a Near Threatened species of bird in the toucan family Ramphastidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.[3][1]Taxonomy and systematicsThe grey-breasted mountain toucan was originally described in the genus Pteroglossus.[4] Two subspecies are recognized, the nominate:DescriptionThe grey-breasted mountain toucan is 41 to 48 cm (16 to 19 in) long and weighs 244 to 370 g (8.6 to 13 oz). Males and females within each subspecies have the same plumage, and the two subspecies have the same bill pattern though the female's bill is shorter. The bill's base is yellow to greenish with a black band near the base. The maxilla's outer 2/3 is red, meeting the yellow diagonally. The mandible's outer half is black. Both subspecies have a black cap, face, and nape; a gray-blue band on the hindneck; a greenish brown back; and gray to gray-blue underparts. Their tail is blackish with chestnut tips on the two or three central pairs of feathers. The nominate subspecies has a bright yellow rump, pale gray-blue flanks, chestnut thighs, and red undertail coverts. Its eye is brown and surrounded by bare blue skin. Subspecies A. h. lateralis has a paler yellow rump than the nominate, pale yellow to gray-white flanks, and a yellow to green eye.[5]Distribution and habitatThe nominate subspecies of grey-breasted mountain toucan is found from central and southern Colombia into eastern Ecuador. A. h. lateralis is found from eastern Ecuador south well into Peru. The species inhabits wet temperate montane forest including cloud, elfin, and secondary forest. In elevation it mostly ranges between 2,200 and 3,650 m (7,200 and 12,000 ft) though it is found as low as 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in Peru and 1,700 m (5,600 ft) in Ecuador.[5]BehaviorMovementThe grey-breasted mountain toucan is not known to have a pattern of movement.[5]FeedingThe grey-breasted mountain toucan forages from near the ground up to the forest's canopy, singly, in pairs, or in small groups that might be extended families. It sometimes joins mixed-species foraging flocks. Its diet is known to include fruit and berries and is assumed to also include some vertebrates.[5]BreedingThe grey-breasted mountain toucan's breeding season spans from December to February in Colombia and from June or July to November in Ecuador and Peru. Nothing else is known about its breeding biology.[5]Dickcissel male perched on a metal pole singing, with neck stretched and beak open.Songs and callsListen to grey-breasted mountain toucan on xeno-cantoVocal and non-vocal soundsThe grey-breasted mountain toucan's song is a "low 'gweeeeeeeat'". Its calls include "wek" notes made singly or in a series, and "kek" notes in alarm or aggression. Songs and calls can include "bill-whacking".[5]StatusThe IUCN has assessed the grey-breasted mountain toucan as Near Threatened. Its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. The principal threat is deforestation from expanding agriculture, mining, and logging.[1] Though it occurs in some protected areas and is thought to be locally common, "[p]opulation fragmentation and inbreeding are possible problems".[5]
AbstractMany Andean and Amazonian species mix up in the Andean-amazonian foothills due to their topography and historical biogeography, explaining its extraordinary bird species richness made up from 404 amazonian and 668 Andean species (16.58% and 27.24% of these are endangered respectively). This study evaluates the avifauna of two regions located in Narino's Andes (Vereda El Paramo and Vereda El Silencio) and Andean - amazonian foothills (Vereda Camino del Viento and Vereda El Verde), both with cloud forests ranging from 2000- 3000m. Fieldwork was done from March 2011 until February 2013, increasing the bird fauna information for these two regions. 167 birds species from 137 genera and 39 families are registered, of which 32 (19,16%) are included in the Important Bird Areas declaration criteria (IBAs), which are important for allowing the selection of priority sites for biodiversity conservation. Following these criteria, the andean and andean -amazonian represent important reservoirs for a large number of birds with different degrees of threat, reason why they should be considered as an important conservation sites.
