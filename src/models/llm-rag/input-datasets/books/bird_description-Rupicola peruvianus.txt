Rupicola peruvianus One of the iconic birds of the Andes. Fairly large, significantly larger and chunkier than a thrush. Found in cloud forest at middle elevations, most often at a dawn display site where males make piglike squeals and jump and dance for females. Sometimes seen elsewhere in the forest, especially at fruiting trees. Males can be either brilliant crimson or orange, always with black wings and broad silver tertials, orange legs, and puffy rounded crest. Female duller brown with smaller crest; note staring pale eye. Nests on large rocks or cliff faces. Only similar species is Guianan Cock-of-the-rock, but no range overlap.Identification & Behavior:Â ~32 cm (12.5 in). The male Andean-Cock-of-the-Rock is bright orange with black wings and tail and a large gray patch on the lower back (tertial feathers). The female is chestnut. Both sexes have pale iris with a blue tinge in the female. The immature looks like a female. The Juvenile male shows orange in various amounts before attaining the adult plumage. It forages in humid montane forests where it associates with vertical faces of bare rock used for nesting.Status: The Andean-Cock-of-the-Rock is uncommon and widespread in humid montane forests of the east slope of the Andes where it is known to range at elevations between 500-2300 m. It also occurs in Co, Ec, and Bo.Name in Spanish: Gallito-de-las-Rocas Andino.Sub-species:Â Andean Cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus aequatorialis), Taczanowski, 1889.Â  Andes of W Venezuela (NW Barinas, TÃ¡chira), C & E Andes of Colombia, and E slope in Ecuador and Peru (S to Amazonas and N San MartÃ?n).(Rupicola peruvianus peruvianus), (Latham), 1790.Â  C Peru (S San MartÃ?n S to JunÃ?n).(Rupicola peruvianus saturatus), Cabanis and Heine, 1859.Â  SE Peru and W Bolivia (La Paz,Meaning of Name: Rupicola: L. rupes, rupis= rock and cola, colere= dweller, to inhabit.Â peruvianus: In reference to the country of Peru.

The national bird of Peru, this species is readily identified by its fan-shaped crest and brilliant orange plumage, both of which are evident to a lesser degree even in the duller female. Males spend much of their time displaying at leks, where they jump up and down on particular branches and utter low, guttural croaks. The name is derived from their preference for rocks and ledges as substrates for their mud cup nests. Often difficult to detect away from leks, birds can sometimes be found feeding at fruiting trees. Distributed from Venezuela to Bolivia in the Andes, the Andean Cock-of-the-Rock does not co-occur with the similar Guianan Cock-of-the-rock of the Guianan Shield.30·5–32 cm; one male 266 g, female 213–226 g (sanguinolentus). Plumage unmistakable; bill strong, and wide at base, becoming laterally compressed towards tip, rictal bristles absent, legs and feet strong, claws large and well hooked. Adult male nominate race has distinctivecrestformed by two rows of fluffy feathers, ventral surfaces of which meet along midline to form semicircular casque; bright orange head, body and majority of lesser upperwing-coverts; rest of upperwing and whole tail jet-black, except for grey tertials (with mostly concealed darker bases); inner secondaries very broad and square-ended; p10 with long slender tip, notched where tip joins expanded portion of inner vane; iris pale dull orange-pink with yellow inner ring; bill intense golden-yellow; legs yellow.Femaleis darkchestnut-brown, blacker on throat and wings,crestsmaller than male’s, eyes pale blue to whitish, bill blackish, legs grey. Immature female is like adult; immature male similar but more orange, bird bred in captivity acquired adult male plumage at 15 months (perhaps unnaturally early, owing to unnatural social environment), but some acquire subadult plumage with body feathers olive-washed and modified secondaries not of fully adult type. Races vary mainly in depth and shade of pigmentation of male’s plumage, extent of grey on inner secondaries, and eye colour, female varying in parallel:sanguinolentusmale has body plumage blood-red, eyes deep red with yellow inner ring,femaleeyes light red with grey inner ring or pinkish grey-brown;<em>aequatorialis</em>isbright orange, somewhat variable, has grey of inner secondaries restricted, eyes bright yellow or orange-yellow with yellow inner ring, female eyes whitish to brown;saturatusis deep orange-red, eyes usually pale blue to whitish with pale orange-yellow inner ring, female eyes sometimes brown.Editor's Note:This article requires further editing work to merge existing content into the appropriate Subspecies sections.

The “National Bird” of Peru.Justification for Red List categoryThis species has a very large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence <20,000 km2 combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the threshold for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (>30% decline over ten years of three generations). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (<10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be >10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.Population informationThe global population size has not been quantified, but this species is described as 'uncommon and patchily distributed' (Stotz et al. 1996)Trend justificationThe species is tentatively assessed as being in decline due to habitat loss per Tracewski et al. (2016).Taxon Name:  Rupicola peruvianus (Latham, 1790) Synonym(s): • Rupicola peruviana Sibley and Monroe (1990, 1993) • Rupicola peruviana BirdLife International (2004) • Rupicola peruviana Stotz et al.

The Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), also known as tunki (Quechua),[3] is a large passerine bird of the cotinga family native to Andean cloud forests in South America. It is the national bird of Peru. It has four subspecies and its closest relative is the Guianan cock-of-the-rock.The Andean cock-of-the-rock exhibits marked sexual dimorphism; the male has a large disk-like crest and scarlet or brilliant orange plumage, while the female is significantly darker and browner. Gatherings of males compete for breeding females with each male displaying his colourful plumage, bobbing and hopping, and making a variety of calls. After mating, the female makes a nest under a rocky overhang, incubates the eggs, and rears the young by herself.The Andean cock-of-the-rock eats a diet of fruit, supplemented by insect, amphibian, reptile, and smaller mice. It is distributed all across the cloud forest of the Andes, having a range of around 260,000 km2 (100,000 sq mi). Even though it is being affected by the destruction of its habitat, the Andean cock-of-the-rock is not classified as threatened.Taxonomy and etymologyOne of two species in the genus Rupicola, the other being the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, the Andean cock-of-the-rock was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1790. It is classified in the Cotingidae, a family of largely frugivorous tropical forest suboscine passerines. The generic name is derived from the Latin stems rupes "rock" or "cliff", and cola "inhabiting",[4] and is derived from its habit of nesting in rock walls. Its specific epithet peruvianus "of Peru" is masculine despite the -a ending of the genus name (in Latin, names in -cola were masculine or neuter); peruviana is seen in older works.[5]Four subspecies are known:[6]R. p. peruvianus – (Latham, 1790), nominate subspeciesR. p. aequatorialis – Taczanowski, 1889R. p. sanguinolentus – Gould, 1859R. p. saturatus – Cabanis and Heine, 1859DescriptionImmature male at the Cincinnati Zoo, USThe Andean cock-of-the-rock is a large passerine, approximately 32 cm (13 in) long and weighing around 265 grams (9.3 oz; 0.584 lb), although males are somewhat larger and the heaviest specimens can reach 300 grams (11 oz; 0.66 lb). The bird is one of many bird species to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism. The male has a large disk-like crest and brilliant scarlet or orange plumage. He has a black tail and wings, and pale greyish scapulars. The female is significantly drabber and browner than the male and has a less prominent crest. The bill is yellowish in the male and dark with a small yellow tip in the female. Depending on sex and subspecies there are significant variations in the color of the iris, ranging from red over orange and yellow to bluish-white in the male, and whitish over reddish to brown in the female.[7] In addition to the display calls described in the breeding section below, foraging birds give a loud querulous "tank?" when disturbed or in flight.[8][9]Distribution and habitatThe Andean cock-of-the-rock is distributed in the cloud forests of the Andes. It lives in a large range of about 260,000 km2 (100,000 sq mi) across Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia,[1] mostly in ravines and forested streams in montane areas at 500 to 2,400 m (1,600 to 7,900 ft) elevation. It typically stays in the lower and middle forest levels but will range higher in fruiting trees and will sometimes enter and cross clearings. It is generally shy and inconspicuous, often seen only briefly after being flushed out or while swiftly flying down a valley.[8]R. p. aequatorialis is the most widespread subspecies, ranging across the Andes of East Colombia to West Venezuela, East Ecuador, and East Peru. The nominate subspecies, R. p. peruvianus has a small range stretching only through the Andes of Central Peru. R. p. sanguinolentus ranges throughout the Andes in West Colombia to Northwest Ecuador. The subspecies R. p. saturatus has a range across Southeast Peru and West Bolivia.[10]BehaviorFood and feedingThe diet consists mainly of fruit and insects, although small reptiles and frogs have been recorded.[11] The fruits consumed are often from the plant families Lauraceae, Annonaceae, and Rubiaceae, although a few other plant families have also been reported in their diet.[9] They are one of many species recorded following army ants.[12] They occasionally will eat high-protein fruits, but they prefer to eat the other fruits on their menu.[9]BreedingMale cocks-of-the-rock are polygamous, and have nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off his magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females.[7] The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see.[8] One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period.[13]At the lek, males have been observed to break up into pairs, performing "confrontation displays". This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, and at the same time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, she becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.[8]Breeding takes place at different times of the year in different areas. In Colombia, breeding normally happens from February until July. In Ecuador, the breeding interval spans from July until February.[14]NestingThe nests, built entirely by the female, are mud-plastered to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines.[15] The nests are often constructed from the saliva of the females mixed in with vegetable matter and mud.[9][14] The nest is shaped like a concave cup.[14] The female typically lays two white eggs.[16] The female incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.[9]Impact on environmentAndean cocks-of-the-rock influence the environment around them. It was found that a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cocks-of-the-rock also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favors the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity of these types of seeds has been found to be increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.[1PredatorsAndean cocks-of-the-rock face slightly larger predators than smaller songbirds. Predators are attracted to leks by the conspicuous behavior of the displaying males. The animals reported to prey on adult cocks-of-the-rock include hawk-eagles, forest-falcons, hawks, owls, jaguars, mountain lions, ocelots, and the boa constrictor.[17]Relationship with humansThe Andean cock-of-the-rock is the national bird of Peru.[7][18] Juveniles and adults have occasionally been pets.[19]ConservationThe worldwide population size and trends in population numbers have not been determined, but it is believed that the Andean cock-of-the-rock is not threatened. The species is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species despite habitat destruction. It is patchily distributed, but its range is large enough to sustain it at a Least Concern status.[1][9]ABSTRACT The Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus) belongs to the Neotropical family Cotingidae, inhabiting the Andean mountains from Venezuela to Bolivia. Despite being a recognised and iconic species, most breeding studies of this bird have focused on its display behaviour at communal ‘leks’ rather than its basic nesting biology. Here, we present novel data on incubation behaviour and detailed descriptions of nests, eggs, and nestling development, with the first photographic evidence of nestlings being fed with vertebrates. We found 38 cup-shaped nests located along rocky walls near rivers or creeks in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. Nests were placed on rocky indentations along rivers, creeks, and waterfalls. The mean clutch size was two eggs. Eggs were beige with brown/green spots mainly located towards the wider end. Eggs measured 46.7 ± 1.2 mm by 32.7 ± 0.3 mm and weighed 25.6 ± 0.9 g. The incubation and nestling period lasted 26.0 ± 1.3 and 40.0 ± 2 days, respectively. During the incubation period, the female was the only parent attending the nest, with an average daily nest attentiveness of 87.3 ± 6.6%. The nestlings grew at a logistic curve rate (K) of 0.135 ± 0.005 g and kept their body temperature constant at 39.3°C only after day 30 of development. Detailed natural history accounts of the nest locations are necessary to generate long-term monitoring and successful conservation strategies of Neotropical species, especially for large frugivorous birds such as R. peruvianus that have long nesting cycles, specific nesting locations and are highly sensitive to forest fragmentation.
