Aulacorhynchus coeruleicinctisSmall green toucan of humid montane forest. Blue chest band is distinctive but can be difficult to see; notice also the bluish coloration in its face and bill and the yellowish bill tip. Forages singly or in pairs through the short canopy of high elevation forest, occasionally associating with mixed-species flocks, especially with other larger birds like barbets and foliage-gleaners. Listen for an even-paced series of low, grating â€œgrrokâ€ù notes.Identification & Behavior:Â ~40.5 cm (16 in).Â  The Blue-banded Toucanet is all green, with aÂ pale throat, a chestnut tip of the tail, and thin paleÂ eyebrow.Â  The lower rump is reddish brown, the undertail coverts are paleÂ green. Â The bill is mostly bluish-gray turning yellowish towards the tip. It has a bluish breast band that can be incomplete. It is similar to Emerald Toucanet and Chestnut-tipped Toucanet but is distinguished by reddish brown rump, bluish-gray bill, and blue band across the breast. Also, see Yellow-browed Toucanet.Status: The Blue-banded Toucanet is fairly common in montane forests of the east slope of the Andes where it is known to range between 1300 â€“ 2500 m. It also occurs in Bo.Name in Spanish: Tucancillo de Franja Celeste.Sub-species: Blue-banded Toucanet (Aulacorhynchus coeruleicinctis), dâ€™Orbigny 1840.Meaning of Name: Aulacorhynchus: Gr. Aulax=scratch, groove and rhunkhos=tip. coeruleicinctis: L. coeruleus=Azure, blue and cinctus= girdled, banded.See more ofÂ the Family RamphastidaeÂ  ÂJustification for Red List categoryThis species has a large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence under 20,000 km? combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population size has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (under 10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be over 10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (over 30% decline over ten years or three generations). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.Population informationThe global population size has not been quantified, but this species is described as 'uncommon' (Stotz et al. 1996). This species is considered to have a high dependency on forest habitat, and tree cover is estimated to have declined by 2.6% within its mapped range over the past three generations (Global Forest Watch 2022, using Hansen et al. [2013] data and methods disclosed therein). It is therefore tentatively suspected that this rate of cover loss may have led to a decline of between 1-19% in the species' population size over the same time frame, with a best estimate of reduction being less than 5%.Geographic Range Country Occurrence: Native, Extant (resident): Bolivia, Plurinational States of; PeruCurrent Population Trend:  Decreasing Habitat and Ecology Systems:  Terrestrial Use and Trade This species was not recorded in any of the trade databases reviewed by Donald et al. (2024) and there is no indication that the species is traded or otherwise used.The blue-banded toucanet is monotypic.[2]DescriptionThe blue-banded toucanet is 40 to 44 cm (16 to 17 in) long and weighs 173 to 257 g (6.1 to 9.1 oz). The sexes are alike. Adults have a bluish horn-colored bill. Their plumage is mostly green with a red rump, white throat, a diffuse blue band across the chest, and greenish-yellow undertail coverts. They have a blue and white supercilium and some pale blue below the eye. Their eye can be any color from white through yellow to reddish brown and is surrounded by bare dark grayish skin. Their tail is mostly green with rusty tips on the central feathers. Immatures are duller than adults but otherwise similar.[3]Distribution and habitatThe blue-banded toucanet is mostly found on the east slope of the Andes from central Peru's Department of Huánuco south to Santa Cruz Department in Bolivia. It also occurs in a few isolated areas further east. It inhabits moist subtropical montane forest and cloudforest. In elevation it is known between 1,470 and 3,050 m (4,800 and 10,000 ft) but is usually found from 1,600 to 2,500 m (5,200 to 8,200 ft).[3]MovementThe blue-banded toucanet's movements, if any, are not known.[3]FeedingThe blue-banded toucanet forages at all levels of the forest, alone, in pairs, or in a small group. Its diet not well known but is primarily fruit and also includes insects and other arthropods.[3]BreedingThe yellow-browed toucanet's nesting season appears to span from January to April or later in Peru and from August to January in Bolivia. Nothing else is known about its breeding biology.[3]Dickcissel male perched on a metal pole singing, with neck stretched and beak open.Songs and callsListen to blue-banded toucanet on xeno-cantoVocalizationThe blue-banded toucanet's song is "a series of barking, growling, variable notes, 'kunnk' to 'krakk'". It also makes "various rattle calls, 'kyak' yelps, a 'kra-a-a' and 'gek-ek-ek' compound notes."[3]StatusThe IUCN has assessed the blue-banded toucanet as being of Least Concern. It has a large range, but its population size is not known and is believed to be decreasing. No immediate threats have been identified.[1] It is considered "generally uncommon" in Peru. "Studies [are] required on its breeding biology and ecology."[3]
