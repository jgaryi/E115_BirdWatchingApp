# E115 - Birdwatching App

**Team Members**  
Jaqueline Garcia-Yi, Susan Urban, Yong Li, and Victoria Okereke

**Group Name**
The Birdwatching Group

**Project**
In this project, we aim to develop an AI-powered bird identification and knowledge application. The app will feature two main methods for recognizing birds: users can either upload a sound file for automatic bird recognition, powered by a fine-tuned AI model, or manually search for a bird by its scientific name. Once identified, the app will provide detailed information, including the bird’s location on a map within the national park and key characteristics about the species. Additionally, a built-in chatbot will allow users to ask bird-related questions, offering expert insights powered by a RAG model.

### Milestone2 ###

In this milestone, we have the components for data management, including versioning, as well as the acoustic and language models.

**Data**
We gathered a dataset of 100,000 cheese images representing approximately 1,500 different varieties. The dataset, approximately 100GB in size, was collected from the following sources: (1), (2), (3). We have stored it in a private Google Cloud Bucket.
Additionally, we compiled 250 bibliographical sources on cheese, including books and reports, from sources such as (4) and (5).

**Data Pipeline Containers**
1. One container processes the 100GB dataset by resizing the images and storing them back to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

	**Input:** Source and destination GCS locations, resizing parameters, and required secrets (provided via Docker).

	**Output:** Resized images stored in the specified GCS location.

2. Another container prepares data for the RAG model, including tasks such as chunking, embedding, and populating the vector database.

## Data Pipeline Overview

1. **`src/datapipeline/preprocess_cv.py`**
   This script handles preprocessing on our 100GB dataset. It reduces the image sizes to 128x128 (a parameter that can be changed later) to enable faster iteration during processing. The preprocessed dataset is now reduced to 10GB and stored on GCS.

2. **`src/datapipeline/preprocess_rag.py`**
   This script prepares the necessary data for setting up our vector database. It performs chunking, embedding, and loads the data into a vector database (ChromaDB).

3. **`src/datapipeline/Pipfile`**
   We used the following packages to help with preprocessing:
   - `special cheese package`

4. **`src/preprocessing/Dockerfile(s)`**
   Our Dockerfiles follow standard conventions, with the exception of some specific modifications described in the Dockerfile/described below.
